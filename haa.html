					This was the first website I created professionally during my first internship asUI/UX Designer. It was a rollercoaster for me since it was the first time I faced a client on my own and their reviews always made me go mad at first. Eventually I got okay with bearing reviews and within 2-3 weeks, I completed their website redesign and they were finally happy with it.
