					We grew up playing with kids in our neighborhood. But as we grew up, our priorities changes. Meeting people around our neighbourhood wasn't even a routine anymore. We got busy in our lives and even on weekends, we always think of resting at home alone or with just a few friends or family. Why not use that time to start catching up with people around us, or maybe just the breakfast / lunch / dinner time. That is the sole purpose of this app.

					While I was cooking pasta, I made just double the amount than I intended to. I quickly messaged in the WhatsApp group of our society asking for anyone who was interested in sharing the food. Many people replied with a 'Yes'. That rang a bell inside my mind that what if I am not the only one, what if there are other too who want to share their food with us but are just hesitating in texting at the first place.<br/><br/>So, I thought about researching about it on google and found that 28% of people are just too conscious about what other thinks about them and they always need a push to talk with others. Then how about skipping the part where we text others and wait for their reply when we can just add something in an app about what we want to share with others.<br/><br/>And on the same hand, how about supporting small businesses like making chocolate at home and other stuff, I planned it the way we can achieve two solutions in the same product.

					I loved working on this app design since it was the first design of my own on which I worked from scratch and researched for hours. This taught me many things like, a simple design can also work perfectly when chosen with the best pair of fonts and colours, the basics of user flow, how to think about easing the user experience, etc.
